# KropScan - Additional Improvements for Hackathon

## 1. Real-time Weather Integration
- Integrate weather API to provide weather-based disease risk predictions
- Suggest preventive measures based on upcoming weather conditions
- Example: High humidity increases fungal disease risk

## 2. Geolocation-Based Disease Tracking
- Use GPS data to track disease outbreaks in specific regions
- Create heat maps of disease prevalence
- Alert nearby farmers about potential threats

## 3. Multi-language Support Enhancement
- Add support for more regional languages (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.)
- Implement speech-to-text for voice-based queries
- Provide audio treatment instructions for farmers with low literacy

## 4. Offline Mode
- Implement a lightweight offline model for areas with poor internet
- Cache common disease treatments locally
- Sync data when internet connection is restored

## 5. Farmer Community Features
- Add a social feature where farmers can share experiences
- Create a rating system for treatments
- Enable expert Q&A sessions

## 6. Advanced Analytics Dashboard
- Provide crop yield predictions based on disease severity
- Historical analysis of disease patterns
- ROI calculator for treatments

## 7. Integration with Agricultural Services
- Connect with local agri-input stores for direct product purchase
- Integration with agricultural insurance providers
- Connect with government subsidy programs

## 8. Drone Image Support
- Optimize model for aerial/satellite imagery
- Large-scale field monitoring capabilities
- Integration with farming drones

## 9. Enhanced Treatment Database
- Add organic/natural treatment options
- Seasonal treatment recommendations
- Cost-effective treatment alternatives

## 10. Gamification Elements
